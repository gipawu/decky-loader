- Persistent. It doesn't need to be reinstalled after every system update 
- Allows 2-way communication between the plugins and the loader.
- Allows plugins to define python functions and run them from javascript.
- Allows plugins to make fetch calls, bypassing cors completely.

## Developing plugins
